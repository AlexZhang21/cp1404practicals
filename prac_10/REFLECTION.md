Throughout this course, I have had the opportunity to engage in practical tasks and gain hands-on experience in various programming concepts 
and techniques. Reflecting on my journey, I would like to highlight two key areas of growth: accurate estimation of tasks and the value of 
code reviews.
Estimates for Practical Tasks:
At the beginning of the course, I struggled with accurately estimating the time and effort required for different tasks. However, as I 
progressed and gained more experience, my estimation skills significantly improved. I learned to assess the complexity and familiarity of 
tasks, drawing insights from previous experiences to make more informed estimates. This growth in estimation accuracy has allowed me to better 
plan and manage my time, leading to more efficient and productive work.
To further enhance estimation skills, I intend to continue practicing and refining my estimation techniques. 
Value of Code Reviews:
Engaging in code reviews has been an invaluable part of my learning journey. Through both receiving and providing code reviews, I have gained 
valuable insights into writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Constructive feedback from reviewers has helped me identify areas for 
improvement, optimize code performance, and expand my understanding of different coding styles and best practices.
Conducting code reviews has also been enlightening. 
In conclusion, I have observed significant growth in my estimation skills and understanding of the value of code reviews throughout this 
course. Looking ahead, I intend to continue honing these skills and incorporating them into my future projects. I also believe that 
incorporating real-world scenarios and industry-standard tools and methodologies into practical tasks would greatly benefit students, bridging 
the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
